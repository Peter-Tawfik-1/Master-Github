Naming conventions must clearly distinguish between production and non-production resources.
All databases must be hosted on servers which do not perform any other functionality such as “web or application tier” or “Domain Services” functionality. 
All databases must ensure that server-side scripting is disabled if not needed.
"The default passwords for accounts and services that are mandatory, for example System"
"Administrator and Listener, must be changed prior to being deployed.  "
Test databases must not be installed upon production systems. 
The versions of DBMS used must still be supported by the vendor. 
"All administrator, user or application traffic to and from the DBMS must encrypted in line with SS-007 Use of Cryptography security standard [Ref. C].    "
"The database must not use unencrypted protocols or non-secure services (for example, HTTP, FTP etc.). "
Unnecessary services or ports must be disabled or removed and where possible.
Databases must be configured to only listen for network connections on authorised interfaces. 
The database servers must restrict network access using IP filtering.
The DBMS must avoid the need to run services with privileged accounts on the underlying host Operating System. 
All installations of a DBMS must be up to date with all appropriate security patches prior to deployment into service in line with SS-033 Security Patching Standard [Ref. B].
Only licensed software which has been verified as being authentic with the supplier can be used for a DBMS. 
All DMBS software authenticity checks must be completed via a cryptographic verification or some other form of secure validation.
"Default accounts, examples, code, files, objects etc. that are no longer required after installation must be deleted from the DBMS and also the host operating system."
The DBMS configuration must not permit default accounts (e.g. PUBLIC) to remain active. 
These must be either:
"a)     Renamed, deleted or disabled (as appropriate); or"
b)     The DBMS / object privileges must not be granted to default accounts which cannot be
removed (or otherwise disabled) unless there is an explicit vendor requirement to do so; or
"c) If the default account cannot be renamed, deleted or disabled (such as root) access must be restricted to known administrative groups."
"Access to such accounts / functions (which cannot be renamed, deleted or disabled) must prevent direct access and require the user to logon with their individual account and then escalate / change their privilege in a controlled and logged fashion."
