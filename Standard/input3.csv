Users must be authenticated before being granted access to the DBMS application permissions or its resources
"DBMSs must authenticate the user (or application requesting access), or if that is not possible, then it must record and log the user which requested that function.    "
Central access control systems should be used to manage access to the DBMS.
User privileges must be granted on the basis of inclusion into roles.  Privileges must not be granted directly to application / user accounts on the DBMS. Please refer to SS-001 pt.2 Privileged User Access Security Standard [Ref. F] for more information.  
All databases must ensure that the HTTP interface is disabled. 
Role-based access control must be enabled and configured appropriately in a fully defined Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model
Each role for each database must only grant the necessary privileges as per the principle of least privilege.  
Each database deployment must ensure that access to data/files reflects the defined RBAC model and assigned permissions.  
"Replication slave backups must be made for all Authority database systems, and in line with SS-035 Secure Backup & Recovery Security Standard [Ref. G]. "
